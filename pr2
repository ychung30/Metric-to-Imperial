Project<2>
Description: Write a program that shows 4 menu options and lets the user to convert from Metric to Imperial system.
Due Date:Mar 21, 2020
I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
I have not given my code to any student.
Print your Name here: Yi Chung

Pseudocode or Algorithm for the program:
    (be sure to indent items with control structure)
    (need to match flow chart submitted in documentation)
    1.Start
    2. Ask user to enter a country name.
    3. Display the menu of Converter Toolkit.
    4.Ask user to enter the number of their choice from the menu,
    5.If the number choice is 1,
    6. Ask user to enter the temperature in Celsius.
    7. Then display the conversion of the temperature to Fahrenheit.
    8. If the number choice is 2,
    9. Ask user to enter the distance in Kilometer.
    10. Then display the conversion of the distance to miles.
    11. If the number choice is 3,
    12. Ask the user to enter the weight in kilograms.
    13. Then display the conversion of the weight in pounds.
    14. If the number choice is 4,
    15. The program quits.
    16. Display the name of the country with “sounds fun!”
    17. End.

//Output should look like this:
//Enter a country name:
//
//Converter Toolkit
//-----------------(17 dashes)
//1. Temperature Converter //F = C * 1.8 +32
//2. Distance Converter    //mi = km * 0.6
//3. Weight Converter      //lb = kg * 2.2
//4. Quit
//
//Enter your choice (1-4):
//Please enter temperature in Celsius (such as 24 ):  //Please enter distance in Kilometer (such as 18.54 ):
//It is __ in Fahrenheit.                             // !!! Program does not convert negative distance !!!
//
//United Kingdom sounds fun!
//
//Thank you for testing my program!
